# USFM-descriptions

A tab delimited text file containing a descriptions lookup table for all **USFM** tags.

I developed this as an external replacement file for use in a bespoke **TextPipe** filter to analyse _USFM tag statistics_.

Column 1 contains the SFM tags each wrapped inside \Q ... \E for use with **PCRE** matching.

Column 2 contains the description of each SFM tag, distilled from the **Unified Standard Format Markers** _User Reference_.

For **USFM** see http://paratext.org/usfm

For **PCRE** see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions

It currently matches **USFM 3.0**rc1

**TextPipe Standard** is available from http://www.datamystic.com/textpipe/standard.html

I've been using TextPipe since 2001. A copy of my bespoke filters may be requested by email.
